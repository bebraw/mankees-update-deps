# Update package.json Dependencies

If you invoke `mankees-update_deps`, the script will walk through your dependencies and update them to the newest available prefixed with `^`. It's a heavy option but something that's what you have to do.

This plugin can be alternatively run through [mankees](https://github.com/mankees/cli).
